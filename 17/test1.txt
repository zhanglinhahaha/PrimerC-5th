You are Absolutely Unique

Enjoy that uniquenesss1.
You do not have to pretend in order to seem more like someone else.
You do not have to lie to hide the parts of you that are not like what you see in anyone else.
You were meant to be different.
Nowhere, in all of history, will the same things be going on in anyoneâ€™s mind, soul and spirit as are going on in yours right now.
If you did not exist, there would be a hole in creation, a gap2 in history, and something missing from the plan for humankind.
Treasure your uniqueness.
It is a gift given only to you. Enjoy it and share it!
No one can reach out to others in the same way that you can.
No one can speak your words. No one can convey your meanings.
No one can comfort others with your kind of comfort.
No one can bring your kind of understanding to another person.
No one can be cheerful and light-hearted3 and joyous4 in your way.
No one can smile your smile. No one else can bring the whole unique impact of you to another human being.
Share your uniqueness.
Let it flow out freely among your family and friends, and the people you meet in the rush and clutter of living, wherever you are.
That gift of yourself was given to you to enjoy and share. Give yourself away!
See it! Receive it!
Let it inform you, move you and inspire you!
You are unique!
